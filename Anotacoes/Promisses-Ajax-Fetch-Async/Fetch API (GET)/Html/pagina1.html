    <p> She'd take the world off my shoulders </p>
    <p> If it was ever hard to move </p>
    <p> She'd turn the rain to a rainbow </p>

    <p> Why then, if she is so perfect </p>
    <p> Do I still wish that it was you? </p>
    <p> Perfect don't mean that it's working </p>
    <p> So what can I do? (Ooh) </p>
